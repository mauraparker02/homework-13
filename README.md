# Hamburger App
## Description:
### Created an app that resturants could use to track of burger's ordered and delivered. The users are able to enter in a burger, and send it out, track if it was eaten and delete to it. Modeled the menu off of Shack Shack, I do not own any of the icons used. 

## Installation:
* Express
* Express Handlebars
* MySQL

## Usage:
### Imagine a linecook needs to quick add an order, and view the order that were already made, they will open the app and be presented with a list of orders that were recently made. Then, the server would be able to add to the list of burgers, to post for the linecook to view. The linecook could throw the burgers into another colum by putting a burger in the "served" column by clicking on the button at the bottom of the column. Any burger's may be cleared from the menu as well.
